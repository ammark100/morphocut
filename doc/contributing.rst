Steps for Submitting Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GitHub Pull Requests are the expected method of code collaboration on this
project.

Please follow these  steps:

1. Fork the `repository`_ on GitHub.
2. Run the tests and make sure that they all pass on your system.
3. Write tests that demonstrate your bug or feature. Ensure that they fail.
   (This is called *test-driven development*.)
4. Make your change.
5. Run the entire test suite again, ensuring that all tests pass *including
   the ones you just added*.
6. Write `meaningful commit messages <https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/>`_.

Documentation Contributions
---------------------------

Documentation is a very important part of this library
and improvements are very welcome!
It lives in the ``docs/`` directory and is written in
`reStructuredText`_. We use `Sphinx`_ to generate the full suite of
documentation.

Bug reports are also very important!
Have a look at the `GitHub issues`_ to confirm that the bug
hasn't been reported before.
